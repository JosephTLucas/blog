## Cool things I've found online

[Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/):  Compare code from a variety of languages with the compiled assembly with different compiler flags in a hihglighted, side-by-side format.  Very useful if you are learning software reverse engineering.

[SQL Fiddle](http://sqlfiddle.com/): A tool for easy online testing and sharing of database problems and their solutions.

[Use The Index, Luke](https://use-the-index-luke.com/): A site explaining SQL indexing to developers; nothing about administration.

[Select Star SQL](https://selectstarsql.com/):  Gentle, relevant, and interactive introduction to SQL.  Learn by solving a real problem with real data.

[SQL Murder Mystery](https://mystery.knightlab.com/): Another engaging introduction to SQL.

[REPL](https://repl.it/):  Great pair programming tool.  Named after the read-evaluate-print loop computing environment, this web-based IDE is great for working on a project with friends or teaching.

[The Deadlock Empire](https://deadlockempire.github.io/):  A fun introduction to some concurrency pitfalls.  Don't worry about the C# orientation.  You'll learn things that you can apply to any language.

[Kubernetes Learning Path](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/kubernetes-learning-path/):  Great kubernetes material.

[Oh Shit, Git!?!](https://ohshitgit.com/):  For when you stray from the happy path.

[Explain Git with D3](https://onlywei.github.io/explain-git-with-d3/): Great interactive graph visualizations for git concepts.

[Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org): My go-to recommendation for folks learning git.

[Pandas Tutor](https://pandastutor.com/vis.html): Great way to teach/understand the logic of [pandas dataframe](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) operations.

[Pythex](https://pythex.org/): Python regex helper

[FLAWS2](http://flaws2.cloud): AWS security challenges

[ttl.sh](https://ttl.sh/): Open Source, free, no signup, ephemeral docker registry.

[shellcheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/): Verbose error messages and recommendations for shell scripts/commands.

[An Infinitely Large Napkin](https://venhance.github.io/napkin/Napkin.pdf): "The Infinitely Large Napkin is a light but mostly self-contained introduction to a large
amount of higher math." I found it referenced as "The Feynman Lectures for math".

[Vulnerabilities 1001: C-Family Software Implementation Vulnerabilities](https://p.ost2.fyi/courses/course-v1:OpenSecurityTraining2+Vulns1001_C-derived+2022_v1/about): Vulnearbility exploitation bootcamp

[NaNoGenMo](https://nanogenmo.github.io/): Write code that generates a 50k word novel. Since 2013!

[A Critical Field Guide for Working with Machine Learning Datasets](https://knowingmachines.org/critical-field-guide): Great primer for building, selecting, and analyzing datasets.

[Meta Kaggle for Code](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/product-feedback/430422): A dataset of public Kaggle notebooks. Goldmine!
