# Fiction

- [The Orphan Master's Son](https://www.amazon.com/Orphan-Masters-Son-Pulitzer-Fiction/dp/0812982622) won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. It's an incredibly well-researched and emotional tale about life in North Korea. Not for the faint of heart.

- [Only Forward](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003IDMUOA) doesn't fit neatly into a genre. Part detective-noire, part.... well, Amazon has it classified under `Steampunk Science Fiction`. It's a wild ride; pure entertainment and not predictable.

- [Three Body Problem](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IQO403K) is some great sci-fi out of China. Original idea, novel framing, and some fun cultural context. This is just the first book in the series; don't stop.
