# Cryptanalysis Curriculum

## Completed

- [Understanding Cryptography: A Textbook for Students and Practitioners](https://www.amazon.com/dp/3642446493): Really great resource for understanding the math and logic involved in modern crypto. I read through and took notes, but need to go back and do many of the exercises. It professes to not be a cryptanalysis book, but does a good job of covering the weaknesses and common attacks for many schemes.

- [The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0385495323): Entertaining read. I would consider recommending to non-computer friends, but still a good survey of the field.

## In Progress

- [A SELF-STUDY COURSE IN BLOCK-CIPHER CRYPTANALYSIS](https://www.schneier.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paper-self-study.pdf)

- [Cryptanalysis: A Study of Ciphers and Their Solution](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0486200973): Recommended in the Bruce Schneier syllabus. Very dense and seems somewhat dated. Slow progress.

- [The Codebreakers: The Comprehensive History of Secret Communication from Ancient Times to the Internet](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0684831309)

- [picoCTF Crypto Challenges](https://play.picoctf.org/practice?category=2&page=1): These seem mainly focused on either old attacks (frequency analysis, known plaintext, etc) or implementation mistakes (OTP reuse), but still fun.

## Found, but still need to review

- [An Intensive Introduction to Cryptography](https://intensecrypto.org/public/)

- [Stanford: Applied Cryptography Group](https://crypto.stanford.edu)

- [The Joy of Cryptography](https://joyofcryptography.com)
