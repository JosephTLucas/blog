# HackThisAI: medium_flying_pig

A walkthrough of the easy [HackThisAI](https://github.com/JosephTLucas/HackThisAI) challenge: medium_flying_pig is available in [this notebook](https://github.com/JosephTLucas/HackThisAI/blob/main/walkthrough_flying_pig.ipynb). * 

Even if you choose to not execute the challenge as a notebook, the cell output displayed in GitHub should give you some ideas about how to complete the challenge.

* This notebook was built locally, so you may need to tinker with some paths (adding your own airplane image, for example).
