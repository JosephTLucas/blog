# Draft No. 4 -- John McPhee

_The only thing I've read that prompted me to pay for a subscription._

[Draft No. 4](https://www.amazon.com/Draft-No-4-Writing-Process/dp/0374142742) was a departure from my normal fiction diet. I picked it up [The Tattered Cover](https://www.tatteredcover.com/) in Denver along with Stephen King's [On Writing](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-10th-Anniversary-Memoir-Craft/dp/1439156816). I chewed through No. 4 in as many days and immediately subscribed to the New Yorker. I've since enjoyed several pieces of narrative non-fiction that I would have missed: "What it's Like to Fight a Megafire," "The Migrant Workers Who Follow Climate Disasters," "When a Witness Recants," and "Can Russia's Press Ever Be Free?".

New Yorker plug aside, No. 4 was engaging for both its insight into the world of professional writing ("Green 15") and exposure to John's adventures. He takes you from idea, to draft, to revision, to publishing. It's a suprisingly wild ride. He focuses on the humanity of the participants, but also manages to share tactical writing advice (how should you structure the story?). He doesn't spout rules in the abstract. He takes you along for the journalism and invites you to review the structure of the resulting narrative together.

There's even a fairly entertaining and lengthy anecode about John's favorite text editor, [KEDIT](https://www.kedit.com/). It doesn't get much more tactical than that. Even for those not consciously working on their writing, highly recommend.
