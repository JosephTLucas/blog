# HackThisAI

I have been contemplating building a capture-the-flag competition specifically for Adversarial Machine Learning (AML). AML includes attempts to evade, poison, or steal/learn about machine learning models. It covers a range of activities and is a young, growing field of study.

Years ago, I took an adversarial machine learning workshop. It was really interesting, but there weren't many ways to continue practicing aftewards. I like the progressive system of CTFs for teaching technical skills.

I've started to prototype some easier challenges [here](https://github.com/JosephTLucas/HackThisAI). I'd love some collaborators. Eventually, I'll pony up for some cloud hosting and front the challenges with [CTFd](https://ctfd.io/) or [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org/). I've also submitted it the "Call for Challenges" for [DEF CON 30](https://defcon.org/).

Training and educating people to think about the weaknesses of ML/AI systems will help us use the hacker mindset to build more robust systems. We increasingly see production ML/AI systems having unintended impacts on society. Increasing the adversarial mindset of ML/AI engineers will help us increase the robustness and understand the boundaries within which we can trust these systems to operate.
